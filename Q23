23.	  a) Analyze the problem carefully and come up with the attributes of given entities and relationships.   Identify the primary keys for all the entities. Identify the other keys like candidate keys, partial keys, if any.
            Entities:  	1. BUS	2. Ticket	3. Passenger
      Relationships:        1. Reservation	 2. Cancellation

b) Write a PL/SQL program that uses all cursor operation on reserves data base

DECLARE
    CURSOR reservation_cursor IS
        SELECT Reservation_ID, Passenger_ID, Bus_ID, Reservation_Date FROM Reservation;

    v_Reservation reservation_cursor%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN reservation_cursor;

    LOOP
        FETCH reservation_cursor INTO v_Reservation;
        EXIT WHEN reservation_cursor%NOTFOUND;

        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Reservation ID: ' || v_Reservation.Reservation_ID || 
                             ', Passenger ID: ' || v_Reservation.Passenger_ID || 
                             ', Bus ID: ' || v_Reservation.Bus_ID || 
                             ', Reservation Date: ' || v_Reservation.Reservation_Date);
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE reservation_cursor;
END;
